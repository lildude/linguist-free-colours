# Available Linguist Colours

This is a very quick, dirty, and hacky script to determine which colours are still free to use with Linguist and print them in a nice big, fat table for easy viewing.

The finished product can be viewed at <https://lildude.github.io/linguist-free-colours/>.

⚠️ The script is incredibly inefficient and takes well over 48 hours to run the very first time. No tears please. ⚠️

## Usage:

```
bundle install
bundle exec ruby ./update-free-colours.rb
```
